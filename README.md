# Myoelectric Prosthetic Hand

This project uses an ESP32 microcontroller to control a prosthetic hand based on muscle signals (EMG). It supports different modes, capacitive touch feedback, servo motor control, and power-saving with deep sleep functionality.

## üß† Features

- **EMG-Based Control**: Converts muscle activity into servo angles to open/close the hand.
- **Multi-Mode Operation**: Toggle between full-hand and finger-specific control.
- **Touch Feedback**: Capacitive touch sensors trigger vibration feedback via a motor.
- **Power Management**: Deep sleep mode triggered via a power button with wake-on-press.
- **Startup Animation**: Visual indication of power-on through servo animation.
- **Button Debouncing**: Reliable toggling of power and mode states.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Components

- 2x Capacitive Touch Sensors (connected to `T4` and `T9`)
- 1x Vibration Motor (controlled via digital pin)
- Power Button + Mode Button + LEDs
- External Power Supply

## üß™ EMG to Servo Mapping

EMG readings are sampled and smoothed using a sliding window. The average is mapped to servo angles using:

```cpp
angle = map(avgValue, 50, 400, 180, 0);  // Adjust thresholds as needed
